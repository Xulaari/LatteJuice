## Welcome to the LatteJuice repository.

This is a launcher that allows you to launch games from the terminal. This will be very barebones unless it gets popular (somehow)

Tested with [vinegar](https://github.com/vinegarhq/vinegar). This may work with [grapejuice](https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice) though, but it has not been tested with it.

### How do i compile it myself?

Run ```make install```. This will clean, build, and install LatteJuice.
